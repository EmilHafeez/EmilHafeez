Hi, Iâ€™m @EmilHafeez. I'm currently a Senior Data Analyst at NYU Langoneâ€™s Department of Population Health, where I leads complex analyses relating to health policy and health economics, including evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on health disparities among NYC schoolchildren and investigating the influence of food policies on large national sales datasets. I have experience in data engineering and analysis, program evaluation, and project management; my interests include using causal inference for identifying policy levers and effects. I hold an MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University and an MSPH in International Health Systems from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, as well as a BS from NYU. Positions my own.
